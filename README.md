# ProjectDocString

## Setup instructions
1. Run ```npm install```
2. That's it.

## Compiling your code
All code gets "bundled" into `bundle.js`, which is then included into the Chrome Extension. 

Everytime you want to test your changes, run ```npm run build```. 

This will build all the JavaScript files and generate a new `bundle.js`, which the Chrome Extension then uses.
